# Agent Instructions

<!-- HARNESS:BEGIN -->
## Harness

Start with the requested outcome and use the repository as the system of record.
Read `docs/WORKFLOW.md` and only relevant product, design, plan, code, and
validation material.

- Answers, explanations, reviews, diagnoses, plans, and status reports are
  read-only. Inspect only what is needed; change nothing.
- For a bounded change, inspect affected behavior and proof, implement, and
  validate. No control-plane operation is required.
- Use one `docs/plans/active/` file when work spans sessions, coordinates
  contributors, has dependencies, or needs recovery. Move it to
  `docs/plans/completed/` only after validation.
- Before editing, identify repository authority for each new externally
  observable policy. If materially different choices remain open, stop before
  edits; configurable defaults are not authority.
- For architecture, reliability, security, or quality invariant work, read
  `docs/patterns/encoding-invariants.md` and enforce only accepted rules.
- Report reusable agent friction. Change guidance, tools, runbooks, or validation
  for that purpose only when explicitly asked to use `$improve-harness`.
- Also pause when product intent remains ambiguous, recovery is difficult,
  validation is weakened, or authority is insufficient.
- Claim completion only with executable or observable evidence. Report outcome,
  changes, validation, and unresolved risks.

Harness has no task database or orchestration lifecycle. Use repository plans
and behavior-level proof; do not create parallel control-plane state.

# GitNexus — Code Intelligence

This project is indexed by GitNexus as **Backend_Server** (4632 symbols, 10708 relationships, 384 execution flows).

> Index stale? Run `node .gitnexus/run.cjs analyze --index-only` from the project root — it auto-selects an available runner. No `.gitnexus/run.cjs` yet? Bootstrap with `npx`, `bunx`, or `pnpm dlx` — e.g. `bunx gitnexus@latest analyze` (npm 11 npx crash; #1939).

## Always Do

- **MUST run impact analysis before editing.** Use `impact({target: "symbolName", direction: "upstream"})` (MCP) or `node .gitnexus/run.cjs impact "symbolName" --direction upstream --repo .` (CLI fallback); report callers, processes, and risk. Never substitute grep for graph analysis.
- **MUST analyze graph changes before committing.** Use `detect_changes({scope: "all"})` (MCP) or `node .gitnexus/run.cjs detect-changes --scope all --repo .` (CLI fallback). `partial: true` or `truncated: true` is not a clean check — a zero means unseen, not unaffected; re-run it. For regression review: `detect_changes({scope: "compare", base_ref: "main"})` or `node .gitnexus/run.cjs detect-changes --scope compare --base-ref "main" --repo .`.
- **MUST warn the user** if impact analysis returns HIGH or CRITICAL risk before proceeding with edits.
- **MUST treat `risk: UNKNOWN` as unresolved, not as low.** An empty caller set is not evidence the symbol is unused — it can also mean the callers are not resolvable by the index (plain-object property access, dynamic dispatch, cross-language calls). `impact` pairs `UNKNOWN` with a `riskNote` saying so. Confirm with a text search before treating the symbol as safe to change or delete; do not proceed on the strength of a zero.
- When exploring unfamiliar code, use `query({search_query: "concept"})` to find execution flows instead of grepping. It returns process-grouped results ranked by relevance.
- When you need full context on a specific symbol — callers, callees, which execution flows it participates in — use `context({name: "symbolName"})`.
- For security review, `explain({target: "fileOrSymbol"})` lists taint findings (source→sink flows; needs `analyze --pdg`).

## Never Do

- NEVER edit a function, class, or method before MCP/CLI impact analysis.
- NEVER ignore HIGH or CRITICAL risk warnings from impact analysis, and never read `UNKNOWN` as an all-clear — it means the walk could not answer, which is the one verdict that requires confirming by other means.
- NEVER rename symbols with find-and-replace — use `rename` which understands the call graph.
- NEVER commit before MCP/CLI graph change analysis.
