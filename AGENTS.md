# Agent Instructions

<!-- HARNESS:BEGIN -->
## Harness

Start with the requested outcome, then use the repository as the system of
record. Read `docs/WORKFLOW.md` and only the product, design, plan,
code, and validation material relevant to the task.

- Answers, explanations, reviews, diagnoses, plans, and status reports are
  read-only. Inspect only what is needed and do not mutate repository or Harness
  state.
- For a bounded change, use an ephemeral plan: inspect the affected behavior and
  existing proof, implement the change, and run behavior-appropriate validation.
  No control-plane operation is required.
- Create or update one file under `docs/plans/active/` when work spans sessions,
  needs coordination or an ordered sequence, has meaningful dependencies, or
  requires explicit recovery steps. Move it to `docs/plans/completed/` only
  after validation.
- Before editing, identify repository authority for each new externally
  observable policy. If materially different choices remain open, stop before
  edits; configurable defaults are not authority.
- Also pause when product intent remains ambiguous, an action is difficult to
  recover, validation would be weakened, or the request does not authorize the
  needed action.
- Claim completion only with relevant executable or observable evidence. Report
  the outcome, important changed surfaces, validation, and unresolved risks.

SQLite intake, story, trace, scoring, audit, and proposal commands are optional
compatibility features. Use them only when explicitly requested or required by
an external orchestrator.

# GitNexus — Code Intelligence

This project is indexed by GitNexus as **Backend_Server** (4007 symbols, 9872 relationships, 300 execution flows). Use the GitNexus MCP tools to understand code, assess impact, and navigate safely.

> If any GitNexus tool warns the index is stale, run `npx gitnexus analyze` in terminal first.

## Always Do

- **MUST run impact analysis before editing any symbol.** Before modifying a function, class, or method, run `gitnexus_impact({target: "symbolName", direction: "upstream"})` and report the blast radius (direct callers, affected processes, risk level) to the user.
- **MUST run `gitnexus_detect_changes()` before committing** to verify your changes only affect expected symbols and execution flows.
- **MUST warn the user** if impact analysis returns HIGH or CRITICAL risk before proceeding with edits.
- When exploring unfamiliar code, use `gitnexus_query({query: "concept"})` to find execution flows instead of grepping. It returns process-grouped results ranked by relevance.
- When you need full context on a specific symbol — callers, callees, which execution flows it participates in — use `gitnexus_context({name: "symbolName"})`.

## Never Do

- NEVER edit a function, class, or method without first running `gitnexus_impact` on it.
- NEVER ignore HIGH or CRITICAL risk warnings from impact analysis.
- NEVER rename symbols with find-and-replace — use `gitnexus_rename` which understands the call graph.
- NEVER commit changes without running `gitnexus_detect_changes()` to check affected scope.
